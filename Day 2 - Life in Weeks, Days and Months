# Get an input from the user's age 
age = input("What is your current age? ")

# Define maximum number of years
max_age = 90 

# Calculating the number of years left and converting to integer 
left = int(max_age) - int(age)

# Define the lenght of each time period and multiply it by the number of years left
days = 365 * left
weeks = 52 * left
months = 12 * left

# Printing the variables using f-string
print(f"You have {days} days, {weeks} weeks, and {months} months left.")
